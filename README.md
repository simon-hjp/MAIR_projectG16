# MAIR_projectG16

Welcome to the Restaurant Recommendations Dialog System project of group 16! 
In this project, we will design, implement, evaluate, and document a restaurant recommendations dialog system using various AI techniques. Our goal is to create a AI-driven system that can assist users in finding a restaurant for their needs.

## Introduction
This project is divided into two main parts:

###Part 1: Implementation of the Dialog System

In the first part of the project, we will focus on building the foundation of our dialog system. This involves:

- **Domain Modeling**: 
We will model a specific knowledge domain related to restaurant recommendations, ensuring our system understands the context.

- **Machine Learning for NLP**: 
We'll implement and empirically evaluate a machine learning classifier for natural language processing (NLP). This will enable our system to understand and interpret user queries effectively and with relatively high precision.

- **Dialog System Application**: 
Using the dialog model and NLP classifier, we'll develop a text-based dialog system application. Users will interact with our system to receive restaurant recommendations.

**Part 2**:
Has not started yet.

## Installation

Make sure you have Python installed on your system before running this command.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt```

##Usage

Describe how users can use your project effectively. Provide examples and instructions as needed.

##Libraries

The project relies on several Python libraries to achieve its functionality. Here are the key libraries used in this project:

- **pandas**: 
Pandas is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library that simplifies working with structured data.
- **numpy**: 
NumPy is a fundamental library for numerical computing, enabling efficient operations on arrays and matrices.
- **scikit-learn**: 
Scikit-learn is a comprehensive machine learning library, providing tools for data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.
- **TensorFlow and Keras**: 
TensorFlow is a machine learning framework, while Keras is a high-level API running on top of TensorFlow. They are used for deep learning tasks, including building and training neural networks.
- **matplotlib**: 
Matplotlib is a versatile data visualization library, allowing you to create various types of plots and charts.
- **LabelEncoder**: 
LabelEncoder, from scikit-learn, is used for encoding categorical labels as integers.
- **TfidfVectorizer**: 
TfidfVectorizer, also from scikit-learn, is used for text feature extraction, particularly in natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

Please refer to the documentation of each library for more details on their usage and capabilities.
